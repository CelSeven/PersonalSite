# PersonalSite
Personal website built with HTML/CSS
- Website is currently under construction 

The website is completely static at the moment. 
Currently, I am self-learning Javascript and JQuery to make my website dynamic. Stay tuned!

You can visit the website at celinachang.pancakeapps.com

I've submitted code on GitHub to show my learning. My code right now is a little rough.
Please bear with me as I continue to clean it up as I go.

Thank you!


Things to do/learn:
- Javascript/JQuery for dynamic elements 
- efficient image storing (host on external website or in Dropbox)
- Gallery image slider - pick a style //design it
- Profile - Hide/Show buttons
- Change header image 
- Fonts
- Mobile site
